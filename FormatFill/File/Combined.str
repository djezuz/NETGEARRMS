You can do this by right-clicking on your files and folders, and selecting the Security tab.

FORCE_CIFS_CASE_SENSITIVITY:::: <b> Force CIFS filename case-sensitivity. </b>  This option provides substantial performance improvement when accessing CIFS shares when many files are being copied; however, before enabling this option, please understand the ramifications.  Windows runs in case-insensitive mode, and one side-effect of enabling this option is that two filenames with different cases (i.e. ABC and abc) will appear as two files but opening one may actually open the wrong one.  Another effect of this option is that you will now need to enter the exact case for search strings for the Find option in Explorer (i.e. find on abc will no longer return file ABC).  Also, some Windows applications that assume case-insensitive operations (i.e. BackupExec) may have problems.  Do not enable this option if you will have clients running Windows NT/95 or earlier accessing the ReadyNAS.

LABEL_CONFIG_BACKUP_EVERYTHING::::<b>Everything</b> - Save all the configuration files used in the ReadyNAS and up to 50MB of data in the data volumes.
LABEL_CONFIG_BACKUP_MISC::::<b>Miscellaneous Settings</b> - Save the configuration files that do not fit in the above categories.  Examples include email alerts and backup jobs.
LABEL_CONFIG_BACKUP_NETWORK::::<b>Network Settings</b> - Save the configuration for all network devices and network-related settings.  This includes the hostname, IP address, etc.

LABEL_DESCRIPTION2,LABEL_DESCRIPTION::::Description
LABEL_DESIRED_VOLUME_SIZE::::Desired volume size
LABEL_DISABLE_CIFS_WRITETHRU:::: <b> Enable fast CIFS writes. </b>  This option allows for optimal write performance by enabling aggressive write-back caching for CIFS transactions.  Do not enable this option if shares on this device will be used by multi-user applications (i.e. Quickbooks) where synchronized writes are necessary to keep files in sync.
LABEL_DISABLE_FULL_DATA_JOURNALLING:::: <b> Disable full data journaling. </b>  Full data journaling makes a backup of data before writing the data out to the intended location, providing an extra level of data protection needed to prevent data corruption for RAID volumes at the expense of disk write performance.
LABEL_DISABLE_JOURNALLING:::: <b> Disable journaling. </b>  Journaling allows very quick file system check in the event of unintended shutdowns such as a power failure.  Write performance with journaling enabled is slightly slower than without.
LABEL_DISABLE_SATA_LINK::::Disable drive connection after
LABEL_DISABLE_USB_SYNC:::: <b> Enable fast USB disk writes. </b>  This option speeds up USB write access by accessing the USB device in asynchronous mode.  If you enable this option, do not remove the USB device without properly unmounting it.  Failure to do so can compromise data integrity on the device.

LABEL_ENABLE_DHCP_SERVICE::::Enable DHCPv4 service.
LABEL_ENABLE_DISK_SPINDOWN::::Enable disk spin-down after
LABEL_ENABLE_DISK_WRITECACHE:::: <b> Enable disk write cache. </b>  Disk write cache allows disk write requests to be acknowledged by disk before data is written out to the platter.  This can give a big boost to write performance, with a drawback that there is a slight chance that unwritten data in the write cache will be lost in the event of a power failure.
LABEL_ENABLE_ISCSI::::Enable iSCSI support.
LABEL_ENABLE_JUMBO_FRAMES:::: <b> Enable jumbo frames. </b>  Jumbo frames allows combining of multiple packets into one large packet, reducing network overhead and increasing large-packet transfer performance.  When a jumbo frame-capable switch is used, and client systems have jumbo frame-capable network controllers, you can enable this option.  Make sure the client network driver is set up for jumbo frame support.
